> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— <br>
I took the one less traveled by, <br>
And that has made all the difference.

Inspired by Robert Frost's masterpiece, here's **The Road Not Taken**, a situational dilemma simulator. 🎲 🔮 

Take a trip through the autumn landscape and face your life, one choice at a time. Whether you want to play it rationally or believe in your instincts, only your fate holds the key to your life. No choice is too small, and no outcome is too big, everything is merely a part of the big picture. 🖼️

## 🙋 Why did we make this?

We want you to put yourself in the shoes of Robert Frost and see how life can throw difficult questions at you.
If there's one thing you know, life isn't that simple and in the end, it's always about answering the hard questions. ⁉️

This game is about the unexpected, nothing is what it seems to be, maybe you know what's coming, maybe you don't.
The real question always is, what will you do about it? 🤔

So take a step back and immerse yourself in this journey - one we are sure you will enjoy. 🍂
